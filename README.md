# Dynamic Programming for Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing

Overview
This README provides instructions on how to compile and run Java programs that implement dynamic programming algorithms for resource allocation in cloud computing environments. The provided Java codes include a naive recursive approach and a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher.
An integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a simple text editor.
Basic understanding of compiling and running Java programs from the command line or IDE.

Files inside source code folder -> DP PROJECT folder

#### `CloudResourceAllocationBottomUp.java`
Implements the bottom-up dynamic programming approach

#### `CloudResourceAllocationRecursive.java`
Implements the naive recursive approach

#### `CloudResourceAllocationTopDown.java`
Implements the top-down dynamic programming approach

How to Run the Codes
Using Command Line
Open the terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.


For the top-down approach:
Copy code:
#### `javac CloudResourceAllocationTopDown.java`
#### `java CloudResourceAllocationTopDown`

For the bottom-up approach:
Copy code:
### `javac CloudResourceAllocationBottomUp.java`
### `java CloudResourceAllocationBottomUp`

For the naive recursive approach:
Copy code:
#### `javac CloudResourceAllocationRecursive.java`
#### `java CloudResourceAllocationRecursive`

# Using an IDE
Open your preferred IDE and import the Java files into a new or existing project.
Ensure that the JDK is properly configured in your IDE.
Compile the code by using the build feature of your IDE.
Run the main method of the respective class.

# Expected Output
Upon running either of the programs, you should see the minimum cost for resource allocation printed in the console output.
